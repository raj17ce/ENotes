			<h2>How does syncing work?</h2>
			<p>All notes are synced between all your devices. When you
				create, edit, or delete notes in any of the device using the same
				account, they automatically and wirelessly sync to the other devices
				through internet using our databases and servers.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="component">
			<h2>Can I search notes without a connection to the internet?</h2>
			<p>No, you can't access the notes without internet. the reason
				for that is, the notes are stored on our database servers. when you
				try to access the notes, you indirectly access our database servers
				through internet. so, accessing the notes won't be possible without
				internet</p>

			<h2>What's the maximum length of a note?</h2>

				Huge notes can take a long time to process both in the web app and
				on your device.</p>
